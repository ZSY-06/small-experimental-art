Overview: This assignment required a lot of imagination and time to create, but I had a lot of fun during the process and it also made me more familiar with using editing techniques.
Process explanation: I used DreamBooth_stable_Diffusion in the fine-tuning notebook to create the AI ​​images I wanted. Then I put the images that matched the image into Cap Cut to make a short video. In the short video, I added sound effects and special effects to make it look like it was moving. I also added some text to let the audience know more about what I was showing.
Why: This process, result, and data set because the dataset I wanted was about landscape, and after the dataset I wanted to create something about autumn, so I used things that can present autumn to make this autumn video.
Brief reflection about the out come: My intention was to present autumn, with leaves turning yellow and then falling, which is the most important symbol of autumn. I want to provoke people to observe plants because I know autumn is coming when I see the leaves changing color.My inspiration comes from the changing leaves and the falling leaves all over the ground.
